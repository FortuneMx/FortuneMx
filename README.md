Hey everyone my name is Fortune. I'm a beginner looking to break into the world of front-end developement. At the moment my current skills are HTML and CSS.
I'm looking to expand my knowledge by learning JavaScript and a couple of frameworks such as Bootstrap and jQuery.
Currently I'm an Electronics student but my passion as I've discovered recently is in web design and development therefore I'm looking to enhance my skills in that area.
Any advice and tips on how I can make my dream a reality is always appreciated. I'm open to collaborating on any project since I'm still learning.
